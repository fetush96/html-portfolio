<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a professional linguist that adores foreign languages. I am really into English and Swedish, but I also used to learn French and Kazakh. Not so long ago, I decided to teach myself programming. That's when I realized I am also very passionate about coding. Programming languages are as exciting to learn and implement as human ones. I aspire to become a junior front-end developer by the end of 2023.</p>
