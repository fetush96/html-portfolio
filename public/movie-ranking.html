<h1>The Best Books According to Oscar</h1>
<h2>My top 3 books of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Second Life Of Uwe, Fredrik Bachman</h3>
<p>We all got a little bit of Uwe's attitude. It's a good book to reconsider your way of thinking and start living your life differently. The book is a good read for anyone.<p>

<h3>Educated, Tara Westover</h3>
<p>The autobiographical novel narrating the wildest experience of the author and all the things she was able to achieve regardless. The book made me feel a wide range of emotions and was a food for thought. It also kept me very involved during that couple of days when I was reading it.<p>

<h3>11/22/63, Stephen King</h3>
<p>This is a very exciting and special story. Loved every part of it.<p>
